# LabPadre_Links
Web page that allow simultaneous views of all 3 lab cams and links to other sites

Usually I open seperate tabs and use Picture-In-Picture to view all of the 
LabPadre cameras at the same time.

This HTML file was created just using copy and pasting "embed" links from YouTube into 
a file and saving it with a name ending in ".html"
This allows me to tweak the locations and sizes of each of the cams, and lets them all show
live, but the Chats are not able to be pasted in the same way.
For the chats, I use the "CHAT" links below the camera views to "pop-out" the chats
and arrange them as seperate windows on the main screen, so I can see everything at once.

Also further down are embedded sites for launches and NASA TV, then links to LabPadre sites
and other spaceX sites.
